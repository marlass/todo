# todo
My todo list in node.js (express) and mongoDB.

Want to implement basic authentication. Later authentication using facebook/github/google oauth. And with that implemented even try to implement my own oauth2 authentication.

Tasks can have deadlines, priority, predicted time to accomplish, defined project, real time to accomplish, done/in progress/blocked/not started. Task can have tags and special requirements. 

Statistics for tags, projects. Predicted time and real time in minutes/pomodoros.

- use webpack for client side js
- babel for ES6
- create basic yo generator for similar apps
- swig for templates
- configure linters for VS Code
- tests with Tape
- sails as nice node.js framework for app/ express for api
- postman for testing API
